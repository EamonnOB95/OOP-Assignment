# OOP-Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to create a superclass (circleBase) and two subclasses (Cone and Cylinder) to illustrate OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes.

The AssessmentDriver class is a work in progress. It's goal is to let the user choose 5 circleBase objects, either Cone or Cylinder. Then specify the height and radius of each object. Finally, sort the objects by the size of their surface area in order to establish the biggest and smallest object.
